You’re given a list of numbers (called an array), and you need to rotate it to the right by k steps. That means each number moves k places to the right, and the ones that fall off the end come back around to the front.
Example:
If you have this list:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
and you rotate it by 3, it becomes:
[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
How it works:
Instead of moving each number one by one (which is slow), we flip parts of the list to get the result faster.
Here’s the trick:
- Flip the whole list.
- Flip the first k numbers.
- Flip the rest.
