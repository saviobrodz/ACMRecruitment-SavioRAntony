To reverse a string, you can do it in two basic ways: using a loop or using recursion. With a loop (called the iterative method), you start from the last letter of the string and move backwards, adding each letter to a new string until you reach the beginningâ€”like flipping the word one character at a time. The recursive method works differently: it breaks the string into smaller pieces by removing the first letter and calling the same function on the rest of the string, then adds that first letter to the end after everything else has been reversed. Both methods get you the same result, but the loop is easier to understand, while recursion shows how problems can be solved by repeating smaller steps.
