- Sorting Algorithm Choice

I have chosen **Bubble Sort** for this task.

--- Reason:
Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, especially for beginners. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Though not the most efficient for large datasets, it's perfect for learning the basics of sorting algorithms.

--- Test Case =
Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]  
Output after sorting: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
