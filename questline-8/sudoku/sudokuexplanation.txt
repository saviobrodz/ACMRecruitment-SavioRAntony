Each number must appear exactly once in every row, every column, and each 2x2 box. The grid starts with a few numbers already filled in, and the rest are blanks.
To solve it, I first looked at each row and figured out which numbers were missing. Then I checked the columns and boxes to see which numbers were already used, so I wouldn’t repeat them. It’s kind of like playing detective—eliminating possibilities until only one number fits.
For example, in the third row, we already had a 3, so I knew I needed to place 1, 2, and 4 somewhere. I checked which of those were already in the same columns or boxes and slowly filled in the blanks. Once a few numbers were placed, the rest started falling into place more easily because the options kept narrowing down.
