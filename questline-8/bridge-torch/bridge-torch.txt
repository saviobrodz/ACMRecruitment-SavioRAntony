Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have one torch. Only two people can cross at a time. The torch is required for crossing. Their crossing times are:-
- Person A: 1 minute
- Person B: 2 minutes
- Person C: 7 minutes
- Person D: 10 minutes

## When two people cross together, they move at the speed of the slower one. Someone must bring the torch back if others are still on the starting side.

Goal:
Get all four across in the least total time.
