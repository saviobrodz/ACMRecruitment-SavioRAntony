The original program initializes 'largest' and 'second' to '-9999999', which is problematic because it assumes all input numbers will be greater than this value. If the list contains only smaller or negative numbers, the result may be incorrect. Additionally, the code doesn't handle duplicate values properlyâ€”if the largest number appears more than once, the second largest might be incorrectly set to the same value. It also fails when the list has fewer than two distinct values, returning misleading results instead of indicating that a second largest doesn't exist.

To fix these issues, we should initialize 'largest' and 'second' to 'None' instead of arbitrary values. During iteration, we update 'largest' and 'second' only when appropriate, ensuring 'second' is not equal to 'largest'. We also add a final check: if 'second' is still 'None', we return a message indicating that no second largest value was found. These changes make the program more robust and accurate across all edge cases.
